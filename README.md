Repo for the NCI-NVIDIA hackaton on June 2023.

## Objective

The objective is to implement sum-factorization techniques for GPU architectures, within
the [Gridap.jl](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl) ecosystem.

Sum-factorization takes advantage of the tensorial nature of Finite-Element(FE) shape-functions
and quadratures to reduce the number of operations required to evaluate FE integrals, by formulating the
integrals as a series of successive tensor contractions with dense small matrices.

This allows for fast and computationally-intensive matrix-free implementations of FE methods.
These implementations compete with the traditional sparse matrix-vector product methods, which
have traditionally been memory-bound. The advantages of sum-factorization techniques become
very noticeable for high-order FE schemes.
